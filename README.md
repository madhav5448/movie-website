## Movie Website Project:-

This project is a simple movie website that allows users to search for movies and view details of each movie.

### The website is built using the following technologies:

## ReactJS:

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## React Router:

A library for routing between different pages in a React application

## HTML:

The markup language used to create web pages

## CSS:

The style sheet language used to control the appearance of web pages

## JavaScript:

A programming language used to add interactivity to web pages

## Redux-toolkit:

A state management library for React

The website is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is responsible for displaying the data to the user, while the backend is not implemented in this project.

The frontend is implemented using ReactJS, React Router, HTML, and CSS. Redux-toolkit is used to manage the state of the application.

## To run the project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Node.js
npm

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project by following these steps:

## In the project directory, create a virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment.
Install the project dependencies. (npm install)
Run the development server.(npm start)
The project will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Here are some features of the project:

Users can search for movies by title, genre, or release year.
Users can view details of each movie, including the title, release date, genre, rating, and cast.

The project is still under development, but it is functional and can be used to learn about web development with ReactJS and Redux-toolkit.

## To-do list :-

Add more features, such as the ability to rate movies, leave comments, and create a watchlist.
Improve the user interface.
User can watch trailor and add to the favorites list
Make the project more secure.
Beckend implementation

## Here are some additional details about how to use the OMDB API in a React component:

The OMDB API requires an API key. You can get an API key from the OMDB website.
The OMDB API returns JSON data. You can use the axios library to fetch JSON data from an API.
The useEffect hook is used to fetch the movie details when the component mounts.
The useState hook is used to store the movie details in the component state.
The movie variable is used to access the movie details in the component.
The movieDetail component can be used to display the movie details on the page.

## How to use Redux

Redux is a state management library for React. It allows you to store and manage the state of your application in a centralized location. This makes your code more predictable and easier to test.

To use Redux, you will need to create a store. The store is responsible for holding the state of your application. You can then create reducers to update the state of the store.
